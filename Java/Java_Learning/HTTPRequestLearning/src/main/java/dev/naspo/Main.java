        Default network request behaviour: Synchronous.
        You'll notice that Java doesn't need to use anything like async/await when making network requests.

        This is because the default behaviour for network requests in Java is to be synchronous, meaning the code WILL
        block and wait for the response before continuing.
        This is okay because Java is multithreaded by design. If you donâ€™t want to block the main thread, you can run
        the request on a different thread (or use async APIs).

        By comparison, a language like Javascript needs to use async/await as the default behaviour for network
        requests in Javascript is asynchronous. This is because JavaScript runs on a single-threaded event loop, and it
        can't afford to block while waiting for a network response.

            Java doesn't have a native JSON library, so we have to use an external library. `gson` from Google is good.
